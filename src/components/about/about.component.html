                    I was once a confused trader tooâ€¦
                    I understood charts, but not my emotions.
                    Every loss taught me one thing trading is not just about strategy, it's about mindset.

                    Today, I teach exactly that:
                    How to think during trades
                    How to build discipline
                    And how every trade becomes a lesson
